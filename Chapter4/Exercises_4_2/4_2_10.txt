RF does really badly in comparison to bisection because a, b are initially near discontinuities and
x1 is hence in a region where f'~0. Hence, little progress is made
in subsequent steps. One expects that the modified RF will improve things
massively since during convergence, one endpoint will always remain unchanged
near one discontinuity. Use of larger DELTA requires more steps but reduces
risk of f(x) = +/- inf being used in calculation.

much better than RF.





f(x) = sin(15x) - 0.5sin(14x)

All calls to bisection take 12 steps,
with residuals < 10^-4

Hence RF clearly beats bisection. Not
sure how MRF will work.

So MRF is slightly better in terms of number
of steps but may take a bit more time.
